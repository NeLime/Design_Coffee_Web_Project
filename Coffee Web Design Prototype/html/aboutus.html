          <h2>CEO & Founder</h2>
          <h5>Edmond Dantes - <span>Founder</span></h5>
          <p>
            Founded by Edmond Dante, a former front-end developer and designer,
            MR.COFFEE began as a passion project born from late nights, big
            dreams, and a deep love for coffee. Growing up in a small town where
            coffee was a daily ritual, Edmond combined her eye for design with
            her dedication to quality, roasting beans in her kitchen and selling
            to friends and local markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a small side hustle has grown into a beloved brand
            known for its craft, warmth, and authenticity. Today, MR.COFFEE is
            more than just a coffee business—it’s Edmond’s way of connecting
            people through meaningful, slow-brewed moments.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <h5>2019 - <span>Asheville, North Carolina</span></h5>
          <p>
            MR.COFFEE was founded in 2019 in the quaint town of Asheville, North
            Carolina, by Edmond Dantes, a former front-end developer and
            designer with a deep love for coffee and craftsmanship. What began
            as a late-night creative outlet—roasting small batches of beans in
            her kitchen—soon evolved into a passionate pursuit. Growing up in a
            town where coffee was more than a drink—it was a daily ritual—Edmond
            blended her keen design sensibility with an unwavering dedication to
            quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selling her first bags of hand-roasted coffee to friends and local
            markets, Edmond quickly discovered that each cup had the power to
            spark connection and warmth. Word spread, and what started as a side
            hustle became a growing community built on authenticity and heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, MR.COFFEE is a beloved brand that stands for more than just
            great coffee. It’s a celebration of slow, meaningful moments and a
            mission to bring people together—one brew at a time.
